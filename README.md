About time!
My First python project and more to come, but as of now about Mouse Click Recorder: 

Features -
1) Record mouse positions and click types (Single or Double click)
2) Set custom delay times (in milliseconds) between clicks
3) Edit or delete recorded clicks
4) Visual overlay highlighting recorded click positions
5) Play and stop click sequences using hotkeys (Tab to play/shoot, Shift to stop) # i prefer saying shoot than "run" cus its fucking cool but i had to name it "run" so people know what it is 
6) Simple and lightweight GUI built with Tkinter # barely 2 months studying python and its already my fav language now but its gui fucking sucks or maybe im just a newbie 

Requirements:

1) Python >= 3.x 
2) Required libraries:
   1) tkinter (included with Python I believe)
   2) pyautogui
   3) keyboard
   4) mouse
      
for dumb asses open cmd and type "pip install pyautogui keyboard mouse" (quotation marks not included) and press enter
